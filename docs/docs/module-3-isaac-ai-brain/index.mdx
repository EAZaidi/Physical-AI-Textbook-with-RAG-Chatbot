# Module 3 Overview

Welcome to Module 3! In this module, you'll learn to build the "AI brain" of a humanoid robot—the complete autonomous navigation stack that enables robots to perceive their environment, build maps, and navigate safely.

## Module Overview

This module teaches you to integrate three powerful technologies:

1. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic robot simulation for unlimited synthetic data generation
2. **NVIDIA Isaac ROS**: GPU-accelerated perception pipelines (Visual SLAM)
3. **Nav2**: ROS 2 navigation framework for path planning and reactive control

By the end of this module, you'll have a complete autonomous navigation system where a humanoid robot can navigate unknown warehouse environments in real-time.

## Prerequisites

Before starting Module 3, you should have completed:

- **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** — Understanding of nodes, topics, services, launch files
- **Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation** — Experience with URDF modeling and Gazebo/Unity simulation

You'll also need:

**Hardware**:
- NVIDIA GPU (RTX 3060 or better, 8GB+ VRAM)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- 16GB+ RAM, 50GB free disk space

**Software**:
- Isaac Sim 2023.1.1+ (via NVIDIA Omniverse)
- Docker with NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill

## Learning Path

### [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim — Synthetic Data Generation](./01-isaac-sim-data)

**Time**: 2-3 hours | **Difficulty**: Beginner

Learn to generate synthetic sensor data in photorealistic simulation:
- Install and configure Isaac Sim
- Load humanoid robots with cameras and LiDAR
- Record rosbags with RGB images, depth maps, point clouds
- Visualize sensor data in RViz2

**Key Skills**: Isaac Sim basics, ROS 2 bridge, sensor simulation

---

### [Chapter 2: Isaac ROS — GPU-Accelerated VSLAM](./02-isaac-ros-vslam)

**Time**: 3-4 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate

Build real-time perception with GPU acceleration:
- Set up Isaac ROS Docker containers
- Configure stereo Visual SLAM for humanoid robots
- Process camera data at >20 FPS (RTX 3060)
- Generate 3D maps and accurate pose estimation

**Key Skills**: Docker GPU setup, VSLAM concepts, Isaac ROS pipelines

---

### [Chapter 3: Nav2 — Bipedal Path Planning](./03-nav2-planning)

**Time**: 3-4 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate

Configure autonomous navigation for bipedal robots:
- Understand Nav2 architecture (planners, controllers, costmaps)
- Tune parameters for humanoid motion (velocities, footprint, clearances)
- Convert VSLAM maps to occupancy grids
- Send navigation goals and monitor execution

**Key Skills**: Nav2 configuration, DWB controller, behavior trees

---

### [Chapter 4: Integration — Complete AI Brain](./04-integration)

**Time**: 2-3 hours | **Difficulty**: Advanced

Integrate everything into autonomous navigation:
- Launch full stack (Isaac Sim + Isaac ROS + Nav2)
- Run warehouse exploration demo
- Handle edge cases (tracking loss, recovery behaviors)
- Monitor system performance (CPU, GPU, latency)

**Key Skills**: System integration, performance tuning, failure handling
