# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This is a comprehensive, hands-on textbook teaching you how to build and program humanoid robots from the ground up using modern robotics software stacks.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers the complete journey from robotic simulation to autonomous navigation and manipulation:

- **Module 2: Digital Twin** - Build photorealistic simulations with Gazebo and Unity
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain** - Implement perception and navigation with NVIDIA Isaac and Nav2

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience (Python recommended)
- Familiarity with Linux/Ubuntu
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started
